    | A crypto wallet is usually a browser extension, and it holds your digital currency, in this case {{ config.eth.chain.nativeCurrency.symbol }}.
    | Once you connect your wallet, you can approve actions on kawaiii‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, such as creating, minting or re-selling a collectible.
    | However, we cannot access your funds or take any actions without your permission.

  p
    | The most common wallet provider is called
    |
    a.link(href="https://metamask.io") MetaMask
    | , and you can download it as a browser extension.
    | Follow their instructions to install the extension and create a wallet.
    | You do not need to have any digital currency to link your wallet with us.
    | You can follow profiles and like collectibles without spending anything.

  p
    | kawaiii‚Ñ¢Ô∏è uses the {{ config.eth.chain.chainName }} network to reduce transaction costs.
    | When you connect your wallet, you will need to approve a chain switch by clicking a button.

  h2#create
    a.link-hover(href="#create") Create a Collectible

  p
    | A collectible is a unique digital item that has a limited number of copies (also called
    |
    i mints
    | ).
    | Once the maximum number of copies is reached, no more can be
    |
    i minted
    | .
    | On kawaiii‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, owning a copy of a collectible gives you exclusive access to hidden content.
    | This makes collectibles valuable and rare.

  Callout.my-1(type="info")
    p
      | For example, if you want a cute picture of your favorite anime character, there may only be 50 copies available.
      | After these, no more can be minted.
      | The only way to get the picture would be to buy one of the existing copies.

  p
    | To create a collectible, fill in the details of your collectible and click the button to create it.

  img(src="/help/3.png" title="Create collectible page example")

  p
    | Creating a collectible implies signing a
    |
    i gasless
    |
    | transaction, which means that you will NOT be charged for it.
    | Yes, creating a collectible is free!

  img.window-screenshot(
    src="/help/4.png"
    title="Gasless transaction signature example"
  )

  p
    | Once the collectible is created, it will appear in your profile, and will be available to mint by others.

    | Owning a copy of a collectible gives you exclusive access to its hidden content.

  p
    | Minting a collectible requires you to pay for it using {{ config.eth.chain.nativeCurrency.symbol }}, which is the currency used on the {{ config.eth.chain.chainName }} network.
    | You can buy {{ config.eth.chain.nativeCurrency.symbol }} from an exchange or use a service like
    |
    a.link(href="https://www.moonpay.com/") Moonpay
    |
    | to purchase it.
    | To mint a collectible, you need to click a button and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
